The construction is very important. Why?  Because you inevitably throw them around in various ways.  You cannot be careful all the time.  And you may not be the only one who uses the headphone.  They inevitably fall down, or the cleaning lady does something.  This headphone has one of the most fragile holder pieces for the earpieces that I have seen.  Look closely at the construction, and notice the plastic U shaped holder that actually holds the ear piece.  It is very fragile.  If you break the holder, you can try super glue to repair, but that tends to be temporary.  Other fine headphones use metal, or Grado has an alternative design.  When my holder piece broke, the company charged me $150 to repair this vital item, which is so fragile and which does not lend itself to easy repair.  That is why I rate the headphone down.  The basic design has not changed in many years, and it surely needs to be upgraded.

Wide soundstage!,R3QCWL28RRG5S3,"I have been using IEMs and 50mm driver headphones for quite some time but this is my first pair of Sennheiser reference cans (that i purchased myself). They are great (granted you have a adequate amp/DAC to power them and provide high quality audio) for DSD256 + MQA. The clamping force of the headphones is nice and isn't too harsh (i have a big head).I like the fact that all the parts are available to purchase from Sennheiser or their distributors directly (such as new open ear grilles, new headbands/earcups/ear cushions, etc. I find that the ear cushions are more likely to wear if you wear glasses and use these frequently. I use these daily for at least 6 hours powered by a FiiO K5 ESS Pro or a FiiO K3 (new model). Due to my glasses, they leave indentations in the ear foam. Expect to replace them more frequently if you use these cans as your main.I tried different cushions up to the dekoni audio cushions, and it affects the sound profile so stay with stock!Concerning sound: Very balanced on the highs, mids, lows until you hit sub bass and then it falls off. They're very close to reference, which is good as you can easily EQ them through your hi-fi or through windows via Equalizer APO (worth it!).The build quality is nice, the body does not attract scratches, and the fabric will hold up as well as the metal band + grille. should you bend the grille in, you can remove it and actually repair it yourself as the headphones come apart quite easily without tools.I will not comment on noise isolation (amazon is requesting this for open backs??) for obvious reasons. The cable that comes with the 650s are generously tough and long almost to a fault (you can see it was provided for someone with a Hi-Fi system sitting at a chair listening and not moving around (like at a computer desk). I would recommend your first upgrade be the shorter cable from Sennheiser, a balanced cable (for superior performance), and a hard case (as the 650s do not come with the re-useable box the older releases came with (but it was cardboard so it wasn't that resilient anyways). Get a nice hard case that you can store the cans in with the cables and a portable DAC/AMP for travel (but definitely do not use these out in the open or during travel say, in a plane). There is no noise isolation and open backs will allow all users around you to hear exactly what you are listening to, note by note.",AH3GANVLHHA7M6OB6ZTFDGFLQ62Q,https://www.amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH3GANVLHHA7M6OB6ZTFDGFLQ62Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,Verified Purchase,Sennheiser Consumer Audio,"May 23, 2022",United States,"[""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/614GufKU-JL._SY88.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61JAXl2DObL._SY88.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61R+sn1FQwL._SY88.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SNtykd-jL._SY88.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61uSmru5ICL._SY88.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/716G1mr2vKL._SY88.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71jnH0Y+O8L._SY88.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71rChgsDuZL._SY88.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71rmsWPR+oL._SY88.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wTx2hBx0L._SY88.jpg""]",0.0,,

I have owned these since Jan 2020, and they have been amazing. While the noise cancellation is not as good as Bose and Sony, it is very close in my opinion. Warning (or bonus) as a parent of small children the noise cancellation works so well I can not hear it when my children are screaming for us at night from their room (my spouse has gotten frustrated by my being oblivious to the crying and not getting out of bed to help them), so I have to turn that feature off at night.Great construction and fantastic overall sound quality with good lows(even without the bass boosting feature which I simply do not use as I consider it unnecessary with the overall bass performance of the headphones).Great battery life is great and the charge is relatively quick (I charge them about every other week while sleeping when it gets to low power ~30%) and use them for 30-40 hours between charges. The battery like have remained long after 9 months of frequent use.The range is great. I generally use them with my iPhone, but I have listened to music on my front lawn with my phone sitting on the back porch about 75 feet away (and through the house) before the connection started to get weaker and loose some signal.And the comfort is AMAZING for someone with a larger head like myself. They are truly my favorite headphones to wear for any length of time. They do not get hot like many over the ear headphones I have used in the past, and they also do not make my ears feel overly pressured like the Bose (I think they were QE35) that I borrowed from a friend for a plane ride years ago.The only letdown compared to my beats solo3 and my SoundCore Spirit X headphones  which I also use frequently, is that sometimes the bluetooth will unpair from my phone, but that seems to really only happen when nothing it playing for a while or then the power gets low, I wish this didn’t happen, but I accept it as a reality when it comes to sub $100 bluetooth headphones.Overall I would give them a 9/10. The only real room for improvement is the Bluetooth connection. I accept that the noise cancellation COULD be better like the $300+ Bose and Sony versions. However, that is simply unnecessary in my opinion as the noise cancellation is already Superb in its current form.I would absolutely recommend these to anyone who is looking for a great set of over the ear headphones at a bargain price.EDIT 01/07/2021 - So about a week ago I started to have problems with the right earphone cutting off and music only playing out of the left ear speaker. The headphone are 11.5 months old at this point and I contacted Anker, with the expectation of being told that it it was not covered under the warranty. Needless to say I was delighted when Anker/Soundcore said they would send me a replacement pair. I received the replacement set earlier tonight (much faster then expected) and I am once again enjoying these great headphones, and I am very happy to have stereo sound again.I have always liked Anker/Soundcore/Eufy products based on their superior fit and finish at a reasonable price, and now feel even more confident about continuing to choose Anker products when given the option I. The future (even over more name brand/luxury options), knowing how well the product is backed if an issue does arises.

The good, cheap, ok sound for youtube, not so good for music.Battery life is pretty decent and as advertised.  No ANC. Magnets on earbuds “snap” them nicely into the case.The bad; Case is slippery and hard to open. Minimalist design gives you a shallow groove to grab a fingernail behind to open. They need to make the groove deeper or mold a little bump out and put some texture somewhere on the case to hold on to. For me, the buds keep falling out of my ears. Experimenting with different tips. They give you five shapes. It wouldn’t hurt if the buds themselves had some texture somewhere on them too.

This review is not biased to having received a free pair and is a genuine review.EDIT: 5/21/20 - These earbuds now frequently disconnect from each other and from all of my devices. While I only have one device on and connected at a time, they all experience the same issue when connected to the earbuds: Sound will constantly fade in and out, drop out at times, and the earbuds will frequently disconnect from the devices entirely. The only solution I have found is to turn the devices' Bluetooth on/off to reconnect. To mitigate the issue, the devices need to be as close as possible to the earbuds and must remain within a 1-2 ft length otherwise the issues will start. Not sure what caused this to happen, though I suspect the daily use has degraded the earbuds functionality. In any case, I have my Pixel Buds on the way from Google which have received amazing reviews.Here is my review after having used the T6s 2-3 hours per day every day for a week.Coming from the Tozo T10s, the T6s are smaller, weigh less, and sound better. The charging case is significantly smaller than the T10's case yet still features wireless charging capabilities. I have been using these for a week now and have not experienced any major issues. So far, the only issue I have experienced has been the earbuds not properly pairing when taken out of the charging case. Due to this issue, the sound can cut from one of the earbuds almost immediately (typically, whichever is paired as the ""second"" earbud). An easy fix has been to put them back in the charging case until the orange charging light appears on both earbuds and then take them out of the charging case one at a time, allowing them to properly pair which each other - I have never had to do this more than once for them to pair properly and this issue only occurs about 10% of the time.In terms of sound quality, these sound clearer than the T10s - though this may be due to the fact that they fit better in my ear than the T10s did. Also due to this, the noise cancellation has been excellent. Being that the T6s are smaller and more lightweight than the T10s, they stay in my ear much more comfortably and never feel as if they are going to fall out. My daily 2-3 hour use of these earbuds comes while I am at the gym (where I run for 1-hour). Despite getting wet from sweat and my head bobbing up and down as I run, they remain securely in my ears. Having a touch interface has also been easier to use, as I no longer have to push the earbuds into my ear to get them to work.Overall, these are great wireless earbuds for the price and the only issue that I have experienced has an easy and immediate fix. I would highly recommend these to anyone looking for great quality, small, and lightweight earbuds that sound great and are easy to use and can be stored in any pocket without bulging out!I have included pictures comparing the T6s to the larger T10s (T6s are on the right for all pictures).",AGAHPPWUSVIUXQ3UXTHT5YBYVU3Q,https://www.amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGAHPPWUSVIUXQ3UXTHT5YBYVU3Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,Verified Purchase,TOZO,"October 30, 2019",United States,"[""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71X6UMXUHaL._SY88.jpg"",""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81GOoOpUGDL._SY88.jpg"",""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81o86nXSqrL._SY88.jpg"",""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81qdh8lsJLL._SY88.jpg"",""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81tC+UshH1L._SY88.jpg""]",1.0,,

But it didn’t surprise,R3RB5NJWYKLTN7,"For my first noise cancelling headphones they’re great! Everything you want. Noise cancelling(NC) for almost everything and ambient noise for talking. When NC I notice that at normal volumes, like 50%, you can hear nearby cars driving and airplanes overhead. The only way you can TRULY NC all of those noises is to raise the volume to near full. And then all you hear is your music. But I haven’t been able to test it out on an airplane. Certain nearby things that you can hear is running water and beeping from other devices, even if you’re indoors and the volume is 50%-60%. When using ambient sound your own breathing and voice is amplified which can help but I notice that people talking farther away or even close is a little hard to hear unless they speak not at their normal volume. So you have to lower your volume and really pay attention to voices. Also the touch sensor on the headphones are both sensitive and not at all. On Apple AirPods, second gen, that I’ve had for years, you could move it around and adjust as you pleased and it would for the most part never trigger an action. BUT for the headphones I find myself almost all the time accidentally switching it from NC to Ambient Sound or pausing to skipping. It’s frustrating. But even when you DO want an action to happen, for example on the AirPods you just double tap on the device. Sometimes not even on the AirPods itself I’ve been able to skip songs just by tapping my ear next to the AirPods itself and it still detects somehow but it knows my intention. BUT for some reason when I try to perform certain actions I need to hit the EXACT spot on the ear piece or I’ll accidentally just pause or switch listening modes. As far as sound quality, yes, an upgrade to my last AirPod second gen headphones. I can hear deeper bass and things I never noticed in songs that I never heard on my last headphones. You have an equalizer on the app that’s included with the headphones and I usually have it on excited which to me blends all the things I want to hear most in my songs",AFEUOKDLP3I6NCU5SPO5SKQL3PZA,https://www.amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFEUOKDLP3I6NCU5SPO5SKQL3PZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,Verified Purchase,Sony,"January 22, 2023",United States,[],0.0,,-0.9037905389612371

They don't look bad but they aren't great either. They feel a little cheap but seem durable enough.Comfort was OK but the lack of padding on the headband and ear cups was disappointing and caused a bit of discomfort.NC was really good as always. Sony has the lead in that category.Sound was better at default settings than the XM4 but I have several options I prefer such as the Shure Aonic 50 (good out of the box with a class leading EQ) and the AirPods Max (I really like their sound signature but it isn't for everyone). The bass is a bit overwhelming and overrides the mids and highs (but not as much as the XM4). The EQ in Sony's class leading app improves the sound (for an easy adjustment I recommend ""bright"" then adfjust to taste if needed) but not to the level of the other two options. To be fair if you like the Sony XM sound you'll like these as it's an improved version of it.This is a good product but it wasn't for me only because I have at least two better options.",AGFIWGPLEBFZ6UZKXAXRR2JROAYA,https://www.amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGFIWGPLEBFZ6UZKXAXRR2JROAYA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,Verified Purchase,Sony,"August 22, 2022",United States,,0.0,$328.00,0.890562046657909

The buzzing was actually caused by the cable i had, which i got a replacement and recently i said heck to their cables due to their price and slightly modified my headphones because of it (WARNING: doing so WILL void your warranty) so they can take any 3.5mm cable.

I wanted to compare them for your sake, because bother are AMAZING cans, and both worth more than their prices (I've bought plenty of cans in the past).  Long Story short, the AKGs stand their ground as classics and the CADs bring some seriously cool characteristics as competition.  (buy both lol)Radiohead: Kid A: Idioteque (non-amped)AKG: Very neutral, almost completely flat at times.  HUGE sound stage.  Lack of directness and isolation, but it feels like you're there live.  Sounds can sound almost as though they are mechanically created they are so real.CAD:  Direct, Isolated, Focused.  Bass is heavy, Treble is bright, you couldn't configure an EQ any more suited to the average listener.Conclusion:  CADs were fun, but you could listen to the AKGs forever and love every second.Winner: AKGRadiohead: Kid A: Idioteque (amped)AKG: Still neutral, but with a bit more punch.  Bass hits are more presence (still not as much as the CAD) and highs have a unique  soft ringing quality.CAD:  Bass really thumps and the highs shine even more.  There is no way to add more sound stage though, just more of the same (which isn't a bad thing depending on your tastes).  Vocals sounded almost too close to the ear.Conclusion:  CADs had tons of power but the AKGs were the same terrific cans as before (non-amped) with more punch and presence.Winner: AKGNIN: Pretty Hate Machine: That's What I Get (non-amped)AKG:  Huge sound stage.  Sounds are soft, and at all distances while Trent's vocals are surprisingly present.  Again, certain sounds have the sharpness and craft to appear almost mechanical and not produced by a speaker.CAD:  Sounds are much sharper and direct.  The bass and treble of the CADs really help in this track, the sound is just... fun.  The quick bursts of silence made a huge impact in contrast with the sharp extremes.Consclusion:  The CADs just added the punch and frequency dynamics that made the track.  The AGK's sounded live and open.Winner: CADNIN Pretty Hate Machine: That's What I Get (amped)AKG:  The softness is gone, and AKGs openness and accuracy portrays perfectly this track's abrupt highs and almost mechanical lows (no longer soft, but quite detailed).  Quick silent parts are contrasted with fast paced, abrupt changes.CAD:  They're loud and direct to a fault, you will not miss a moment.  Bass is big and brooding, but the highs lack the snap that the AKGs had.  Sounds move around quickly on these cans, but always within close proximity.Conclusion:  The CADs sound powerful and amazing, but you will never forget the hugeness of the AKGs and their absolute authority on this track.Winner:  AKGThe Dolly Rocker Movement: Our Days Mind The Time: Coffin Love (un-amped)AKG:  The sound is almost smothering yet without appearing too close... the male and female vocals take the stage and fill your ears beautifully.  Sound stage sounds perfect.CAD:  Very clear sounding and extremely close proximity.  Sound stage is bigger than usual, but not comparable to the AKG.  Vocals are even more present, and very clear and precise.Conclusion:  The AKGs are extremely open and lively, while the CADs are a bit too close but amazingly precise.Winner: AKGThe Dolly Rocker Movement: Our Days Mind The Time: Coffin Love (amped)AKG:  Blissful openness and naturalness, with tremendous kick and clarity added in.  The AKGs are carry vocal detail and characteristics extremely well here.  Guitar is very pronounced now.CAD:  Almost overwhelming in its up front characteristics (feels like the singers are two feet from your face).  Like the AKGs, the guitar is also very pronounced now too.  Very amusing listen, but very taxing.Conclusion:  The CADs sound amazingly up close while the AKGs sound like you're there.Winner:  TieFront 242: Front By Front: Terminal State (un-amped)AKG:  A very relaxed take on an EBM sound.  Sounds are a bit further than normal, although everything is very present and articulate.CAD:  Bass and treble have more authority than before.  Sounds are very present and extremely detailed and textured.  For once, sounds almost mechanically produced on the CADs as opposed to the AKGs.Conclusion:  The AKGs have a distant/softer approach to this track.  The CADs are powerful and in charge.Winner: CADFront 242: Front By Front: Terminal State (un-amped)AKG:  The softness is gone and it is AKG's signature soundstage coupled with snappy highs and lows which hit hard.  Sounds are extremely detailed and easy to identify and understand.CAD:  Thumping, authoritative sound.  Right in your face (or your ears) sound with all the bass authority and treble clarity you could want.Conclusion: The CADs are extremely strong and in charge.  The AKGs are wide open yet precise and very snappy.Winner:  TieLet me just say that neither of these cans are a bad deal by any means.  Let me also say that neither one is better than the other.  In fact, I say, own both, they complement each other extremely well.  If you have to chose one or the other, just keep in mind, AKG = huge sound stage, CAD = powerful and direct.  I will say the CADs are immensely fun and the AKGs are blissful to listen to for long times; and both benefit from an amp (even a cheappo - tried many).  Choose what suits your tastes (or get both).If you want headphones for: rap, hiphop, industrial, ebm, electronic, etc... choose the CADIf you want headphones for: new age, rock, alternative, classic, psychedelic, etc... choose the AKG-but really that's not true... its really sound stage over directness... choose your flavor!",AFAHS7GGVVWAY5J3MN3HXIQ5G36A,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFAHS7GGVVWAY5J3MN3HXIQ5G36A,Verified Purchase,AKG,"November 3, 2012",United States,[],4.0,,

I should not be able to accidentally call someone while trying to pause my workout playlist, that defeats the purpose of any convenience.The sensors on the outer surface are nowhere near sensitive enough to tell the difference between a single tap (pause), a held press (volume up/down, or power off), or multiple taps to do things like turning on voice commands and stopping whatever you are listening to.If you try to pause, you may instead skip back/forward past the song/podcast you are listening to, and if your ears are sweaty or if you are in the shower, expect one earbud to think you are constantly pressing “volume up/down” until you either damage your eardrums or mute your audio (happens to me at least once a week). Get used to the robot voice repeating to you “MAXIMUM VOLUME, MAXIMUM VOLUME!” at maximum volume while you scrape shampoo out of your eyes and race for a towel to dry off and remove the offending earbud. It seems to happen any time there is too much pressure on the earbud, like if you are lying down on a pillow and trying to fall asleep.I am not making any of these scenarios up, this happens on a daily basis with these earbuds, including turning on voice commands and making a call to CVS without me saying a word.It’s a shame, because they have good battery life and sound, and are fairly comfortable. If the touch functions could be disabled, they would be nearly 5 stars. They sit well in my ears and are fairly good at passive noise cancellation. I have in fact purchased two sets based on their battery life and how much I use ear buds every day, however the touch controls are awful on both and cause daily frustration.I would simply buy another cheap set, but based on Amazon searches all the cheap companies appear to use the same internal components since they all “boast” about the several touch functions on the earbuds. All we need is play/pause, thank you. Give us the ability to disable it or don’t include it, it is in no way a “feature”.",/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHMD7N4EKWGFZKEEBXVJL4MOKVYQ,https://www.amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHMD7N4EKWGFZKEEBXVJL4MOKVYQ,Verified Purchase,TOZO,"January 2, 2023",United States,[],6.0,$26.99,

Paired perfectly, sounded amazing and the noise cancelling was unbelievably good.However, after that 2 week period the magic disappeared and the noise cancelling had somehow degraded.I work in an aerospace manufacturing facility. Those first two weeks these earbuds were able to noise cancel massive CMM machines, our Shaker Shack (a testing environment which simulates in-flight conditions, it's so loud it shakes the building) and all other industrial noises. A few months later, the noise cancelling doesn't even work for voices or the odd cart rolling by. It is better than not having noise cancelling, but immensely disappointing.Also the Bluetooth pairing has degraded somehow. Where once it was precise when pairing, the earbuds now will randomly pair to my phone when closed in the case.The included ear tips are great! ...while they last. After a month the default tips had fallen apart. I used the small size ones for the past two months and they have now fallen apart. 3rd party replacements are not nearly as good. For Sony to not have replacement tips for purchase is odd and frustrating.Overall the low score is the result of poor consistency of features. The sound is great, they look cool, the case is a good size. But for almost $300, I expect the biggest selling points of the incredible noise cancelling matched with amazing sound quality to hold up for more than 2 Weeks.After that 2 Weeks, you might as well have gotten a pair at half the cost. Sure you won't get 3D sound, but your expectations will be met for that price.My guess as to why these earbuds suddenly stopped being effective at noise cancelling is due to either bad firmware updates or the ""learning"" the noise cancelling performs just not working correctly.I would save your money and buy something cheaper.",AFR5G6GGH5TWPD4DV7RG74H577GQ,https://www.amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFR5G6GGH5TWPD4DV7RG74H577GQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,Verified Purchase,Sony,"February 3, 2022",United States,[],2.0,,-0.9075339815833351

They're much lighter than I expected, and I can lay back comfortably with them without any edges bumping on my chair.  It makes for a great listening experience.I do really like that they use a standard 3.5mm jack, so I can use any old extension cable, but the cable it comes with is great.  I really wanted to pull the cable in and out to get an exact reference to with and without bluetooth, but every time I unplugged it, it unpaired and shut off.  It also kills the tilt to pause function when they're plugged in.I used the Korn Dead test as it's become the best way for me to determine the quality of headphones.  That song starts out with highs, adds lows, and lot of mids, and then plays everything together.  Quality headphones will allow me to hear everything seperately.  Poor quality will mush everything together like trying to play basketball with bad depth perception.  With noise cancelling on, it sounds like upper level mediocre.  Turning off noise cancelling sounds much better.  It seems that I have to choose between quality or killing background noise.  It's worth keeping in mind that most people probably won't hear the difference, and if I wasn't directly paying attention to the music I might not either.The bass is great.  I could actually feel the vibration in the earcups if I turn it all the way up.The noise cancelling is what I would call pretty good.  If I turn the music off and want to sit in silence with noise cancelling on, I can still hear the words of people around me, and can make out what they say.  To get the effect I want I would have to play some white noise.  If I listen to music with noise cancelling on, I can't hear anything around me.I really like the smart features to turn down the music when something important is happening.  One of the big reasons I don't use headphones often is because I'm always paranoid that I'm going to need to answer the door, or my phone's going to ring, and I won't be able to hear it.  In fact, the number one reason I use these is because I can pair them to my computer and my phone, and when my phone goes off it'll automatically switch to my phone.  I miss even less by having these on.Overall I'm very happy with these headphones.  They produce great sound, and if I need something to drown out snoring, I can throw on the noise cancelling with some white noise to put me in my own world.  Then when I get a call in the middle of the night, I'll send it right to my ear where I need it.Highly recommended.",AGNRIU5SSWEDHHLJKHM2U3SDSLNQ,https://www.amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGNRIU5SSWEDHHLJKHM2U3SDSLNQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,,Sony,"September 3, 2020",United States,"[""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61+3ljWtECL._SY88.jpg"",""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/612z15Xvp1L._SY88.jpg"",""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61IoELinigL._SY88.jpg"",""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61MJH8C2RLL._SY88.jpg""]",1.0,,

I was looking for a bluetooth pair that could also be connected via wire, which these do (continue reading to see my issue about using these with an aux cord).  They are reasonably comfortable, though like many over the ear headphones, I start feeling them after about an hour.  They seem fairly well built.  They come in a very nice case, that you could easily pay 15 to 20 bucks for.  I like the app for these headphones even more than the one for the speaker (you can have multiple custom EQ presets, and some of the factory ones are actually decent).  I had no trouble connecting the headphones to my phone or laptop.  I do find the buttons on the headphones a bit hard to see and find, but I don't typically use any of them other than the on/off one, instead using the app to control things.  I haven't delved into the noise cancelling quality of these, so I can't comment on it.  However, my big problem is that when connecting these headphones via aux cord, there is no noise cancelling, and I don't believe that the custom EQ's work, leaving them sounding significantly worse in corded mode than bluetooth.  I am disappointed in the sound quality in corded mode, but otherwise I've had a positive experience with them so far.Update:  I spoke with a Soundcore rep and confirmed that you cannot use the EQ app or Noise Cancellation when using the aux cord, only when using with Bluetooth.  The sound when using the cord is pretty lousy, IMO.  If your primary use would be with a cord, I would suggest you look for another model.  If your intended use is Bluetooth only, these are a worthwhile purchase.",AG7LC6TUCB6ONOZ2RN4Y76D7T7WQ,https://www.amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG7LC6TUCB6ONOZ2RN4Y76D7T7WQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,Verified Purchase,Soundcore,"November 13, 2021",United States,[],2.0,,0.8363211154937743

On the long run this will break the headphones.Sadly, these Soundcore headphones, made by Chinese company Anker, are light years behind models from either bose, sony, jabra or sennheiser. Of course, they are also cheaper thus more easily affordable for everyone. That’s why I’m not giving them a negative review, because at 200 bucks they cost 2x less than the high-end brands mentioned above.

I didn't really care about Bluetooth a whole lot, but did think it would be fantastic to have while walking to school. However a cord doesn't bother me very much. So the bass is phenomenal in the 700's especially compared to the QC25. The QC 35 are ok, but like other reviews have said for Bluetooth to even pair with your device you have to have a Bose app. I find the Quiet Comfort series to be slightly more comfortable than the 700's, the 700's have a little too much force holding them against my ears. So I have returned them because they are OK but nothing seems to be too new with the noise cancelling for advertising 11 levels of noise control to block out the world around you.

The features are poorly implemented, and the core functionality is poorly implemented.Why is there not a single pair of Bluetooth headphones on Amazon under £100 that isn't terrible?  For this price, this should be a premium product, but it's unreliable and poor quality.The first problem is the equaliser.  Because these headphones contain a small computer, the manufacturer cannot resist the urge to include a software equaliser, it is AWFUL, and the out-of-the-box settings are unusable.  Unfortunately you cannot simply disable this feature, you must install an Android application (!!) and use that to configure the headphones.  Ordinary wired headphones, which have been used for decades, do not have this problem.  Nobody wants an equaliser in their headphones.  Nobody wants a mobile application to configure their headphones. Nobody asked for any of this.The second significant problem is the undocumented inclusion of some physical sensor, the purpose of which is to detect when you remove the headphones from your ears, so that media can be paused automatically via Bluetooth.  Ordinary wired headphones do not do this. Nobody asked for this. Nobody wants this.  It does not work reliably, so content randomly pauses when the headphones send spurious signals.  Worse than useless - it would have been better to do nothing.The third problem is the same as affects all Bluetooth headphones - they cannot maintain a stable connection, requiring frequent reboot.  Poorly debugged firmware.  After years and years of development of the Bluetooth ecosystem, it still cannot reliably replace three bits of copper in a stereo cable.",,,Verified Purchase,Soundcore,"February 8, 2022",Canada,[],1.0,,-0.9087679602883079

Another great feature is that they don't carry noise from the cord - by which I mean, a lot of headphones will carry a thumping sound into your ear if the cord strikes something, making it really annoying to walk or run with them because that cord is wiggling around all the time (big problem with Skullcandy headphones). These don't have that problem, probably because the cord is so lightweight.To sum up - great value, good decision. 10/10 would buy again. Will buy again.

These probably sound 90-95% as good as the Bose but come a little short on the multipoint connections.  Noise cancelling is also pretty good but doesn't block out quite as much.  They are way ahead of all my other sub $80 headsets though.I have been working from home a lot multipoint is a major factor for me.  The Bose will connect to both my PC and phone simultaneously whenever I turn them on.  These will only connect to one of the two and I have to connect to the other manually every time (but will stay connected to both).  It's a bit of an annoyance so hopefully they can fix that with firmware.  The other advantage the Bose have is a hardware switch to turn them on instead of a press and hold button.  The switch is significantly quicker and works 100% of the time.On the other hand the Q30's have a few advantages over the Bose.  They can adjust active noise cancelling with a button.  You can only turn Bose off with the app.  Also passthrough mode can easily be activated by a button or cupping your hand over an earcup (which I always forget to try).  Bose needs the app or it will do it automatically with a call.Comfort wise it is a close call but I would give the edge to Bose because the earcup shape fits my ears better and they are a little lighter.  The Bose also fold down a bit better, with a smaller case, so better for travelling.All in all though I was impressed and keeping my fingers crossed for a firmware update on the multipoint.",AE6ABBZTLULQTTWFRKW6GJG3MQAA,https://www.amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE6ABBZTLULQTTWFRKW6GJG3MQAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,Verified Purchase,Soundcore,"January 28, 2021",United States,[],0.0,,-0.6667629697106101

The sound is good, and the noise cancellation is OK (but not great). Good enough to hear a movie on a plane, but a lot of noise still comes thru. I haven’t tried the noise amplification because I don’t use these when running.The biggest problem I have is battery life and charging. After the first few weeks, the right earbud wouldn’t connect to the charger. This is an issue for two reasons: first is it cause the earbud to not disconnect from my phone. Second, it meant the earbud wouldn’t charge, and when it did it seems like it doesn’t get a full charge. Yesterday I used them while working outside, and because of the charging issue the right earbud dropped out after only an hour of playtime. Then yesterday the left earbud started having the same issue with not connecting to the charging case.In short, the earbuds are fine, but the charging case seems to be the biggest issue.",AGR2IZ3SP5DUAXNXINQZ4VPDE7MA,https://www.amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGR2IZ3SP5DUAXNXINQZ4VPDE7MA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,Verified Purchase,TOZO,"August 14, 2022",United States,[],1.0,,-0.9045636653900145

They were pretty good for the beginning.  I liked the wireless feature, they sounded ""decent"" as long as you used the right sized earbud and created a tight seal in your ear canal.  All was grand at first.After about two weeks I noticed the the Pause/Play button quit working.  At first I figured it was just a software issue so I deleted the device from my iPhone and repaired it.  It worked for a brief amount of time but I had to do that  process about 3 more times in the next couple of weeks.  It got really old after a while having to do that so I just ignored it for a while.Well, I then decided I would do it again and get it working.  Only this time, it didn't start working again.  This may sound petty, but it's a real pain in the rear to have to take your phone out all of the time to pause or play the music.I went back down to the AT&T store and asked if they had anyone come in with the same issues.  The guy at the counter had the same headset and said his were doing it to and that I had to call LG and they would send me a new pair.  That wasn't a good sign, but I was content with the idea of them sending me a new pair.  Oh how I was wrong.When you call LG, you get ""JR"" in the Philippines who is just overjoyed to help you in your dire situation.  He gladly will give you the address so that you can 1) Find a box  2)  Remind you that you better have that receipt to prove that you are under warranty (even though the headphones haven't been out long enough to be out of warranty)  3) Pay to ship the box to LG  4) And chance that they might not replace with a new pair but attempt to repair yours.After I got of the phone with LG I got pretty mad.  I didn't see how this was all my problem since I paid so much for these and they crapped out so fast.  I can see why they don't want to send you a new pair and want you to go through the hassle of shipping and paying for it yourself.  They are banking that you won't do it.  I called back and expressed my thoughts.  After that they offered to mail me a shipping label.  I still called their bluff because we have this so called technology of email.  Then they offered to email it and I accepted that because that was the best I could get.  Also, don't try to talk to a manager, they won't let you unless you call during bankers hours.Well, after a couple more days the forward/back button quit working intermittently until it just crapped out all together.  I called back again and told them I was fed up that they couldn't just send me a new pair and then I send the old pair back in that box.  They told me that that is not how business works.  I asked them what the turn around time was and they said 7-10 business days.  The usual.THIS IS WHERE IT GETS GOOD!I explained to them that when I had an issue with an iPhone Apple send me a new one and I returned it in that box with no issues.  The customer service guy said that if I spent $900 on a product of theirs like I did with my iPhone 6 plus......they would replace the product immediately.  I told him that is crappy business and he laughed and then responded with ""that's how it is in business""So, long story short......go buy some other brand.

Having broken them in, I've been using them to listen to music and watch moves, mostly on my computer. Their sound quality is superb; significantly better than that of my Altec-Lansing sound dock, which is touted for the crisp perfection of it's speakers.In terms of comfort and use, I find that after an hour and a half or two hours of uninterrupted listening they become slightly uncomfortable. Even though the pads around the ears (and under the headband) are thick and comfy, the headphones do squeeze your head fairly tightly (and my head is a little narrow, if you have a wider head they might be slightly less comfortable). Taking them of for a minute or two, I find, allows me to listen for another few hours without much trouble. They don't have active noise-canceling circuits, but are very effective at deadening sounds. With music playing, you only hear very loud outside noises, and those are softened.The cord is about four feet long without any extension - it's a coiled cord, and extends up to about six feet before it starts to tug the headphones in an uncomfortable way. The pads and cord are replaceable.Overall, fantastic headphones, with excellent sound quality, sound dampening, and comfort.

Cough Sennheiser cough.For the record I own both Hi-fi man and Sennheiser brand headphones, but more on that later.Looks are always subjective but in my mind the X2HR does a fine job of juggling looks, quality materials and a heavy duty build tough enough for a tour in a 1940's U boat, probably.Fit:The X2HR for me, are a very comfortable headphone, they have a good seal and feel balanced upon my medium sized head.Sure it's a touch heavy but as Boris the blade would say, ""Heavy is good, heavy is relaible""SoundThe first impression that's noticable about the X2HR is the vast soundstage, some headphones give the impression of listening in a telephone box, the X2HR will sound like you're in St Pauls Catherdral.The overall sound signature is warm with a very expansive bass, like a eager puppy, the X2HR just wanna have fun.Even before EQing these cans are liberal with the bass which in turn creates a very fun, non fatiguing, and enjoyable sound.If you're the type of person who values detail, imaging and a neutral sound then start looking at other headphones such as Senheisher or AKG as the X2HR's are not for you.The mid range is slightly recessed compared to other headphones with vocals hanging a little back into the mix giving a feeling that the X2HR have a slight veil to them.The treble is there but rolled off and not as crisp as other headphones I own and while the imaging is ok, it lacks the space inbetween instruments that other rivals can deliver.While some of the above may seem a bit critical I can tell you for the price, even at retail, these are minor concerns at best. Other plus points to consider is the attack and easy to drive nature delivered by the X2HR making numerous, more expensive headphones sound almost languid and shy in nature.The final string to the X2HR's bow is the ability to play low bitrate files extremely well, so no need to get rid of those 128kbps tracks because just like your best friend, the X2HR has you covered.Competition:X2HR V Sennheiser HD599SEThe main rival staring down the X2HR's are probably the HD599SE which have a similar RRP, and can often be found on sale at £99, just like the X2HR.Both have great comfort, build and fit, with the HD599SE being lighter although being 100% plastic certainly helps which may in turn put some people off.The 599SE offer a good soundstage but not quite as wide as the X2HR but still wider than some of it's far more expensive siblings.Both are open back and will leak sound although the HD599SE slightly less in this regard.The HD599SE is the slighly more laid back and cleaner of the two headphones although both are warm sounding. The HD599SE are perfect for listening to vocals and less bass heavy music., that's not to say it can't do bass but the X2HR does it better, and with far more slam, while the bass also digs deeper. The 599SE are more detailed without crossing into the realms of brightness and both will do a stellar job for single player gaming and films. In fact watching Das Boot through the X2HR was a fantastic, immersive and intense experience.Thoughts:Both are great headphones for the price and if you have a wide range of music you could easily justify buying both when on sale.The next step up on the headphone ladder in my view are the Hi-Fi man Sundaras.While the Sundaras are capable of magic, and are my pride and joy, they are not without a few issues and at more than double the cost. The extra cost will net you at the most, a mere 15-25% improvement.The law of diminishing returns can be a cruel mistress in the world of audio and both the X2HR and HD599SE will be end game for most normal people who aren't hellbent on chasing audio nirvana like audiofools such as myself.For retail price the X2HR are more than worth it and at £99?Then it's a deal, a steal, a sale of the flaming century!(Providing you dig the sound signature)When you factor in the X3 is the latest model and stock of the X2HR will be limited, I may buy another one as these are my first choice for films and gaming.If you made it this far then a socially distanced high five and congratulations to you!",,,Verified Purchase,Philips Audio,"April 24, 2021",United Kingdom,[],12.0,,

With the included 1/4"" to 3.5mm (locking) removable cable, it means no need for clunky, easy to lose adapters. Build quality is good, and the phones are easy to drive with a good amount of bass. Noise cancellation is passive, so it depends on how tight they are over the ears. They're decent, but of course not as good as active noise cancellation Have listened to these phones over the last week and have not gotten fatigue that you can get from phones that have overly heavy bass or accentuated treble.

The Bose Music App felt more like beta software and lacks polish. Headphone has difficulty maintaining connection to the Bose Music App, and reconnecting interrupts music.  Waited for as long as the Amazon return period before returning, and there was still no software update from Bose.Pros:- Amazing ANC.- Solid build quality.- Comfortable.- Great sounding.Cons:- Bose Music App lacks polish. Unable to hold connections. Reconnecting also fails multiple times before succeeding. Interrupts music upon reconnecting.  Also need to sign up and login to use the App, not sure why.- Stays on my head well while looking down; tends to fall off while looking up (the ear cups would flip over).  Also unable to wear while lying down for this same reason.- I would prefer more bass in the sub-bass range. I own other Bose products as well, such as Bose SoundSport earbuds. The other products also with ""Bose Signature"" sound has considerably more sub-bass than NC700.Overall, I really liked the Bose NC700.  The deal breaker for me was the poor Bose Music App. I own other Bose products and the old Bose Connect App was fine.

But prior to just lately, transcriptions were full of errors.

Upon receipt I noticed there was a carrying bag in the package (these headphones should not come in a bag).  After pulling out the headphones, they were not Sony WH-1000XM4, but some Samsungs.  Obviously, nobody checked before shipping or replaced them during shipping.  The tape on the box, that thanks me for giving the item a second life, was pull off.  It looked to be tampered with.  I guess I won't be giving these another chance and I'm not sure if I'll ever give 'renewed' another chance either.Original review:ANC is great, but situational.  Please understand that ANC does not make music sound better.  It blocks out ambient sounds, noise and voices.  It won't cancel out direct wind nor your chewing.  While the sound is very good, I'm sticking with my Sennheiser Momentum TW's, which in my opinion sound better.  Mid's to me sound a bit muted, otherwise the highs and lows are pretty good.  I'm not a huge fan of over the head cans either, but I was willing to give these a shot.  Being able to pair these and have them connected to multiple devices is a big plus, but as always trying to use these (BT) as a computer mic/headset is a very poor experience, especially with Discord (I really wish companies could figure this out).  Great battery life and these can be updated with firmware for future proofing.  The white is not really white, it's more gray and contrary to some belief, they do not look more premium, but they don't look cheap either.

Works great with some devices, but horribly with others",R16CCYY1X60S67,"When used with one device, this headset works very well. I like having the 3 different modes. Transparency mode and noise cancelling are what I use most often, but I’ve used normal mode in a few situations. With transparency mode, I can hear people in the room clearly, but they don’t have to hear whatever I’m listening to, and sounds from outside the room are less distinct. These headphones work very well with my phone and tablet. If I unpair them from those, and connect to my laptop, it won’t work for more than a few minutes without the volume pulsing strangely, popping sounds, or crackling. If I turn them off and back on, they sound fine for a few more minutes before problems start again. As other reviewers have stated, the sound quality is very good, but doesn’t compare to high-end headsets 3x the cost, and the microphone quality is passable for phone calls, but not much else. I have used them for 2 days between charging, without them powering down. They stay connected further away from the source than expected. They’re comfortable enough to wear all day. It is especially nice to be able to connect to 2 devices at once, so you can watch a movie and take a phone call without removing the headset. I use them nearly every day. They will not cancel out every single noise, but they help a lot.

The audio is clear and they have great bass response with a good seal to the ear.  They fit like a normal set of headphones or you can flip them over like a set of pro in-ear monitors.  Either direction they feel like a solid fit.  Each side has dual labels so you know which headphone goes where depending on how they are being used.  I agree that it would be nice if there was a volume control on them but that’s not a deal killer for me.  I had the hardest time trying to find any instructions for them and then realized they were on the side of the box.  Duh.

These are hands down some of the best sounding wireless earbuds you will get in this price range. ANC is the best you will find on any pair of truly wireless earbuds. When I say scary quiet I mean you wont hear that car crossing the street. You wont hear the washing machine doing laundry. You might not even hear your dog barking. As for touch controls they are made so that when paired with the app you can control different things on each side. You can also customize it however you would like. Another nice feature that all headphones companies need to adopt is  EQ controls which im glad to say sony put here . My only gripe is the eartips. While foam is good for adapting to different peoples ears it lends its self outside the active consumer. Really makes it hard to recommend for runners. But honestly outside if that small gripe I would say these are some of the best truly wireless earbuds you can buy.,AFZMXLLZFEB7S77Y24MSG7PVRX2A,https://www.amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFZMXLLZFEB7S77Y24MSG7PVRX2A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,Verified Purchase,Sony,"July 8, 2021",United States,[],0.0,,0.8923463929783213

The adjustment clips are very smooth and the headphones fit my head perfectly. The sponge part is also decent and feels like a quality product. It has a long curled wire which is very convenient. It has a 3.5 mm jack and has a quarter inch adapter, again very rich quality. Headphones are heavy and pretty tough.Performance:The voice and bass quality is very good. The noise cancelation is pretty effective as compared to other studio headphones I have ever used. It has been a year I am using it and I am completely satisfied with the sound quality. Very good for Production, Mixing and Mastering.I am using it with Focusrite Scarlett 2.2 and works excellent.Comfort:Very Comfortable and handy. You can fold it inwards and it takes very less space. It has a supreme quality sponge fit to both ears and at the top for head comfort. Use it for 2-3 hours without any pain or trouble. It totally depends on person to person anyways.Price:I got this for 6,600/- (discounted price) and for that price it is totally worth.

I'm no audiophile so I'll refrain from talking about anything other than the comfort.My initial concern was that these would not be comfortable to listen to for long periods due to the snugness and weight. However, after a day or so of owning these I think I'm starting to prefer the snugness and it doesn't hurt me at all. The extra weight isn't as bad as I thought it would be, since the headband and snugness work together nicely to keep the weight distributed. It will get mildly discomforting on the top of my head after a half hour of wearing it, but is fine for the next half hour after adjusting the positionThe only thing I'm not happy about is the heat. I don't get sweaty or anything (haven't tried working out with these though and don't plan to) and these are probably better than most headphones in this regard, being open back and all, but I previously owned the SHP9500 and those stay cool forever.

The sleek design, and thin wire are great for an on-the-go student, or any frequent gym-goer. They mimic the look of Beats by Dre wireless headphones, but for a fraction of the cost.  All together a great bargain headphone, that doesn’t compromise quality for the lowered price. The battery lasts nearly eight hours, meaning I have never been able to run the battery dry in one day’s use. I am usually timid when it comes to using bluetooth technology, because I like the reliability of a cord, and not having to rely on a charged battery every morning. The Otium headphones are incredibly easy to set up, with four buttons in total; two for volume control, one utility botton, and a large power button.  The power button is on the side, and it about the size of the tip of your index finger.  The power button is always easy to find without seeing it.  The other three buttons are tucked on the underside of the headphone.Making sure the user has bluetooth turned on, on their phone, and holding the utility button for five seconds activates the pairing mode almost instantly.  I have never had issues where I need to reconnect the headphones after the first pairing.  This is nice when I am starting a workout, because I don’t lose any precious time when I’m ready to start jogging. The design is great as well. Unlike competing headphones, like Apple Earpods, the Otium wireless headphones have hooks that ‘lock’ the earpieces around the ear. The only time I have had one fall out is with a set of 100+ jumping jacks, which is something I would imagine any headphone to have issues with.  Another thing that sets them apart from Apple Earpods, is the cord that connects the two earpieces.  For any user even half as clumsy as I, they will surely appreciate this feature. These headphones are wonderful for anyone, regardless if you are a gym-goer or not.  The noise quality is great, the battery life is longer than anyone will need in one day’s work, and they stay secure and free from readjustment all day through.  The price is great for a student looking for an affordable bluetooth headphone option, and a one year warranty is definitely a source of incitement for any timid shoppers, like myself.",AG66J6KUFDHFUPQT6MOUDS4JUIRA,https://www.amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG66J6KUFDHFUPQT6MOUDS4JUIRA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,Verified Purchase,Otium,"February 17, 2019",United States,[],0.0,,

All the professional reviews glowed about the sound and the ANC; best around. They were right about the sound, I was able to compare them to my wife's Pixel Buds Pro, and as good as those are, these were noticeably better. The sound was wonderful! And while I assume they were right about the ANC, it wouldn't turn on. The Ambient mode did work, but ANC was identical to Off. The instructions were obvious--if I turned it on via the earbuds, or via the app, it would highlight that ANC was on, but there was absolutely no change in the blocking of noise, even a steady drone that even the worst ANCs do fine with.So I exchanged them for a new pair with the same result. No chance I missed something--obviously I was turning the ANC on, and it's not like I don't know what using ANC sounds like. I followed the troubleshooting guide, including hard and soft resets, with both pairs, but no joy. Finally as a longshot I called Sony customer support, which walked me through the same troubleshooting steps (I didn't need that, I do this kind of thing for a living), but I loved the sound so much I wanted to make triple sure I hadn't somehow missed something. Nope, ""Please send them in for repair"".

The A3 style is what I needed, a pair that did not fit so tightly inside of ear so I could hear surrounding noises.  The A3's were exaclty what I wanted (also they were on sale).  So far I have been very happy with the other Tozo products I own so figured this would be a safe purchase.  For comparison in the photo the White pair are the Tozo-A3 vs. the black pair Tozo-T6.The Pros:The setup and pairing with your phone was simple.  They have nice audio quality, the bass and highs sound good to me. They are very lightweight, I forget I have them in at times.  The Touch controls (play/pause) are very responsive and work great.  So far the battery life has been excellent, and the charging case keeps them charged up.  Has a USB-C style plug to charge and charging is super fast.  The price point is very affordable for a nice pair of headphones.The Cons:No Wireless Charging which is not a big deal for me as USB-C is fine.  Not water Proof, for what I needed them for it didnt matter but assumed they were.The ergonomics took a bit of getting used to.  Taking the headsets out of the case, they must be turned around to be placed in ear and when putting them back into the case the same applies.  Also the square design causes a bit of fumbling to get them in the case.  Only saying this because the Tozo-T6 headphonse are smooth as silk when taking them on/off and placing back in the case.To sum up, I would recommend the Tozo A3's.  These are very nice headphones for an affordable price from a company that I have bought other great products from.

I did a lot of research and it was clear that there was no one model that was best at everything. So, I prioritized what I was looking for (in rough order):1) physical comfort (nothing else really matters if they're painful to wear)2) blocking out outside noise (household noise, cars passing by, leaf blowers, etc.)3) technical ease (i.e., easily connecting to both my phone and laptop)4) microphone quality (for phone calls and Zoom)5) sound quality for music (I tested with EDM and IDM music)6) cost (I was willing to pay more for quality as long as it wasn't outrageous)7) battery life (not really important to me as long as it gets through the workday)After a lot of reading, I narrowed it down to five:Bose 700Sony WH-1000XM4Jabra Evolve2 65Jabra 85HJabra Evolve 75And I ultimately ordered the top 3.Here's my review:Sony WH-1000XM4:- This was the clear winner for me: most comfortable, best at blocking out outside noise, excellent music quality, and easy to use- I appreciate how it automatically adjusts the noise canceling settings based on activity (sitting still, walking, etc.), and I had no trouble connecting it to my phone and computer at the same time- The biggest downside (other than the high price) is that it was definitely the worst microphone of the three. People on the other end were able to understand me, but when I listened to recordings it definitely sounded more muffled and less clear than with the other two headphonesthough its microphone quality isn't great- It's probably also worth mentioning that my brother tried these on and he found them uncomfortable because he has large ears, whereas the Bose 700 felt fine for himBose 700:- This was a close runner-up: good at blocking outside noise, comfortable enough (but I felt it squeezing my head more than the Sony), and good music quality (I even preferred it to the Sony for some songs, though in general I felt like the instruments were somehow a bit further away or flat compared to the Sony)- It gave me just a little trouble to connect to phone and computer at once but it was fine once I got it set up the first time- The microphone was noticeably better than the Sony's but still not greatJabra Evolve2 65:- Surprisingly good music quality given its purpose as more of an office headset; but, given its protruding microphone arm, I was expecting significantly better mic quality than the other two when in fact I only found it to be a little better than the Bose- Fairly comfortable, but I preferred the way that the other two completely enclosed my ears rather than just squeezing against them as the Jabra did- Setup was easy and I appreciated the USB dongle to wirelessly connect it without fiddling with BluetoothSOME TAKEAWAYS:- Ultimately, I learned that all of these have pretty bad microphones, so you'll need to get a dedicated microphone if you really care about recording sound quality- This is of course personal preference, but I still find my Jabra Elite Sport earbuds from 2018 to be more comfortable than all of these, and they surprisingly had just as good or better microphone quality than all of these fancier larger headphones. I'm able to wear the Sony or the Bose headphones for a few hours, but my ears still feel a bit tender when I take them off- I was quite surprised that the active noise canceling was fine for me on both the Bose and the Sony. I had tried a previous Bose model years ago and experienced a lot of painful pressure on my ears, so I was quite happy to discover that I rarely experienced that here. I'm not sure if the tech has just gotten better or if I've acclimated somehow, but consider giving the Bose or Sony a try even if you've had trouble with this in the pastDECISION:I ended up choosing the Sony WH-1000XM4, which are in most ways the best headphones I've ever used (with important caveats below). When I started my search, my top priority was how well they worked for Zoom calls. Music quality was a secondary concern. But after spending weeks with these headphones, I'm pretty blown away by how my music sounds, like new dimensions have been opened up. I recommend them, along with the Wavelet smartphone app for AutoEq equalization tuned to these headphones specifically. However, there are two glaring flaws you should know about:1) The microphone quality really isn't great. When I'm in Zoom meetings, I set it to use my laptop's built-in microphone instead since it sounds better.2) It does pair well with my laptop and smartphone at once. But, there are some quirks that are extremely annoying. Whenever one of the two disconnects, a voice loudly announces, ""Bluetooth device disconnected."" So, say I'm listening to music on my phone or on a phone call—if my laptop falls asleep or I turn it off, my music or call will be interrupted with that useless announcement. Even worse, whenever you answer a phone call, it disconnects momentarily from the computer, so as soon as your phone call begins it makes that loud announcement and you miss the first few seconds of your call.Yes, you heard that right: If your laptop is on and the headphones are connected to it and your smartphone (which is supposed to be one of the best features), then every time you answer the phone the first few seconds of the call will be interrupted.So that's why it loses one star. But truly, the music quality and noise-canceling are so great that I really like them anyway and am willing to work around this limitation. I sure wish Sony would release a firmware update though allowing us to disable that voice completely!",AHYELS2PGI2XCI3HB3O5UDG3JQUQ,https://www.amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHYELS2PGI2XCI3HB3O5UDG3JQUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,Verified Purchase,Sony,"January 10, 2021",United States,[],3.0,,

They add to my style, help with focus and look nice, but just because this is something I look for may not be the same for you. One of their biggest features that is advertised through every single picture you see on the Beats Studio 3 is it’s Noise Cancellation. The noise cancellation feature allows for a reduced ambient sound and allows you to focus on the audio you may be listening to and can be controlled for me the volume setting on any iPhone device. My only problem with the noise cancellation is that, although it may reduce the ambient sound, you will still hear most of sound outside unless you have music or a loud audio playing on your headphones. Now although it’s not that big of a issue because it serves its purpose I find it intriguing the way the Noise Cancellation is advertised on video rather to the on-ear noise cancellation experience. Aside from that one detail these beats use a apple chip that makes it extremely easy to connect to your Apple device no matter the age or technical intelligence and comes with a extremely fast charging cable that gives the headphones 3 hours if battery life with only ten minutes.

That said they are working as they should, they just have a poor quality of sound and poor uncomfortable fit.  I bought them to replace a worn out set of Logitech 600 Bluetooth headsets I've been using for several years with my notebook, these Skullcandy HESH 2 Bluetooth wireless headphones just don't match up to the cheap Logitech 600's.!  The fit is bad, the ""over ear"" headphones are not, they sit on top of the cartilage structure of the ear and are very uncomfortable there.  Imagine a firm donut made of a hot, hard piece of Styrofoam pressing against the rigid structure of your ear not covering your ear at all.  Annoying at best, especially for the weight of them.  These Skullcandy Hesh 2 headphones are a bit too heave to have an ""on ear"" fit, they would be OK weight wise if they actually fit over your ear as advertised, but they don't.Sound quality was poor as well, again the old Logitech 600 Bluetooth headsets not only fit ""on ear"" much more comfortably, but they have a much better sound quality...  Yup, that's right!  The cheap Logitech 600s I had to just have a portable set of headphones to use and not bother others in the area with my noise have a better quality sound than these Skullcandy Hesh 2 units.  The Logitech is sharper, better acoustic range and better bass clarity than the Skullcandy Hesh 2!  I listen to a variety of music, everything from AC/DC style hard rock to light Jazz, do some minor gaming as well.  The falling apart, foam covers falling off, light weight Logitechs out perform the brand new, uncomfortable Skullcandy hands down!Nothing wrong with these Skullcandy Hesh2 headphones as far as working, they work just as fine as they are capable of I guess, they just are not very capable when compared to even a cheap set of a different brand of headphones. I also have a set of Corsair VOID Wireless I use with my main desktop system, I cannot in good conscious hold these Skullcandy Hesh 2 units up to compare to the Corsair VOID, there is no comparison, none, nadda, not even on the same planet, much less ball park.  Not sound, fit, comfort, or performance.The Skullcandies don't even belong in the same paragraph as the Corsairs when mentioning them!!

I ordered two sets for me and my significant other to use with the program, and they were sent alone in a box in bags- no instructions on how to use, install, or troubleshoot. I just spent the past three hours trying to figure out how to make these headphones work with two different computers, and ended with the conclusion that they are defective. I have consulted the product website, as well as other FAQs online. I worked with both a PC and Mac; the device was recognized (no problem there at all), and was good to go as part of both computers (green check marks and everything). But when I go to use the actual headphones, the microphone works and can recognize my speech, but the headphones do not at all. I don't hear anything at all, no crackling or faint sound (and no, the headset is not muted on the cord). This has been extremely frustrating, especially considering no instructions were sent with the headsets initially. Even the instructions online were thoroughly unhelpful beyond initial set up.In addition to my horrible experience installing and using the headset, the headset itself is not very comfortable at all, as the name might suggest. The ear pads are very small, so unlike other earphones that I have had before that encompass the entire ear for comfort, these just sit on top and add extra weight. After a few minutes, my ears were already a little tender. Especially with a program like Rosetta Stone, I was looking for a headset I could use for a decent amount of time, and again was disappointed. I would definitely invest in a more quality headset, or a more quality company.",AG3T3NOBCKPKFVKNFSE6ANCEJCEA,https://www.amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG3T3NOBCKPKFVKNFSE6ANCEJCEA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,Verified Purchase,Logitech,"December 28, 2012",United States,[],1.0,,-0.9086257761174982

So, for years, I’ve drugged myself instead of using a mask (legally). I saw this on my Amazon home page and it looked like it was selling a dream, but I thought I’d try to give it a shot, and maybe be able to actually dream with it. Here is my experience with it so far (I’ve had it for about a week). I was super skeptical when I first tried it. I thought the Bluetooth and sound stuff was going to be complicated. But, I literally just hit the power button and it synced to my phone super easy, and the sound was great. I’m a side sleeper, and I have trigeminal Neuralgia, which makes anything putting pressure on or around my ear excruciating. But, once I moved the speakers where I wanted them, I hardly felt them at all -on a firm pillow, I sort of felt them, on a fluffy pillow, I didn’t feel them at all. Additionally, there’s a ton of room between the mask and my eyes. As far as light leakage, I read some of the reviews before I bought this and someone mentioned they had a little. But, for me, even when I’m broad daylight, it’s literally light’s out -which kind of makes it hard when you wake up in the morning and the sun is suddenly blasting in your face. But, for falling asleep, amazing. So, maybe depending  on peoples facial structure there could be light leakage where you may just have to adjust the mask a bit to avoid that. But, wasn’t for me (I have a long, narrow sort of face). Here are some things to watch out for: if you have strap on too tight, you might feel where the buttons are on the front of the mask and get a headache. -I did. But, then I just loosened the strap just a little and everything was fine (even with the strap a tad loose, I had no light leakage). One other thing is that I have no idea how long the battery lasts. I sleep about 8 hours, sometimes less, sometimes more. Haven’t had any issues so far there. But, I don’t know what happens when the battery starts to get old or how long it would take for the battery to get old. I hope this review is helpful!",AGPMPEPHW76FJMEGPAIKN32H6YUQ,https://www.amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGPMPEPHW76FJMEGPAIKN32H6YUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,Verified Purchase,MUSICOZY,"May 20, 2022",United States,[],14.0,,

While having a few features the XM3s do not have, these are very touchy in terms of controls...swiping and at times even pairing.  Sony's decision not to allow a surround sound/virtual stage element to me was a major disappointment.  On the plus side, the headphones do fit better on the head and are comfortable, thanks to the larger earcups too.  I guess since these are similarly-priced to the XM3s, the decision has to be what is more important...some added features and good battery life, or the presence missing with the lack of a virtual stage presence we see in the XM3s.  Unlike the Bose 700/QC35II, these Sony phones have about 50% more hours of battery life per charge.  They are also more comfortable than the XM3s due to bigger earcups.  I currently like my Bose QC25s as you don't need to deal with rechargeable batteries, but when they break, I would consider this one, espcially if the Sony WH1000XM3 is no longer available.  And I read that Sony may change the swipe feature for volume, or improve it, with a dedicated button in the XM5s, but I don't really know if they're that far into the XM5 planning cycle.Update:  June 4, 2022.  Having received the XM5 as a birthday gift from my kids, I've increased the rating on these XM4s.  They are clearly superior over the XM5s.  Lower price, easy foldability, less plastiky, no fingerprint smudges, and a more comfortable headband make the XM4s the better option, while still providing outstanding sound and NC.",AHH57AA5ODNS3OXCUYEYUFCLD7IA,https://www.amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHH57AA5ODNS3OXCUYEYUFCLD7IA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,,Sony,"November 17, 2020",United States,[],2.0,,-0.7621947743675925

Inside the box is the headphones in a high-quality artificial leather bag, 3 cables, the instruction manual, and the warranty card. There were two audio cables, one of them for use with regular electronic devices, and the other for DJ equipment, and one charging cable, all surprisingly high quality and durable. The warranty card instructs you on how to claim your ""2 years warranty"", and went over their services-- ""30 days of free shipping"", ""Get a new product for your reasons"", and ""Solve the problem at any time"". I've already registered my product for the warranty, and it was very simple. The headphones have rich bass, and great sound quality. They have a great design, and are incredibly comfortable to wear. However, about a week ago, my headphones unexpectedly broke when I picked them up to put them on. The connector that helps the headphones swivel broke, and I couldn't put it back together. I was skeptical about the ""2 years warranty"" at first, but it turned out to be great. OneOdio responded to me within a day after my inquiry on the warranty, and asked me to send a picture or video of my issue. After sending them a picture of my issue, they emailed me and told me that they were going to ship me a new pair. I was very impressed with the support. If you are skeptical about these headphones, don't worry, because you can just claim your warranty if you dislike them or they break. Even though they broke for me, I think it's pretty unlikely to happen again. In conclusion, if you want good, comfortable headphones for under $60, these are a great option!",AEK2M2SFIXDJBAON3BUTNWHXI2FA,https://www.amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEK2M2SFIXDJBAON3BUTNWHXI2FA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,Verified Purchase,OneOdio,"December 21, 2019",United States,[],0.0,,0.9038931673223322

Before that I owned a pair of HD448's, which broke when I accidentally crushed them in my backpack, and then a pair of HD449's, until my rabbit bit the cord in two. I was initially excited when I received these. I had tried several brands of headphones including AKG's, Sony's, and Audio-Technica's, but I had always thought my cheap Sennheiser's sounded better. These headphones, being Sennies, would be just as good, I assumed. I can't easily convey you the disappointment I felt when I listened to the first track with the HD280's. A good analogy might be going to a restaurant for the first time that everyone says is good, but is honestly mediocre, like Olive Garden. The difference being that you have to stand that disappointment every time you listen to music, not just when your friends drag you there for endless breadsticks. I kept a smile on my face for an entire song to please my girlfriend, but I was just hoping all the while that it was only an effect of not being properly broken in. That was not the case, they did not get better, or grow on me.These headphones have bass, a very flabby and undefined bass. People complain about the cheap Sennheiser's for the same reason, but I can guarantee that these headphones are worse in that regard. Sennheiser's are known for their high-end detail, but these have none. The sound is balanced, but un-nuanced, totally cheap, like they are being driven by weak magnets. I honestly believe these are $50 headphones that Sennheiser stuck their name on and up-charged $50. When doing a head-to-head with these headphones vs. the Sony MDR-v6's I got my girlfriend, I'd choose the Sony's, and they are $60 new. The sound isolation is great, probably a bit better than the HD449's I had. It accomplishes this by squeezing your head so tight you might think it would burst. I can only comfortably wear these for about an hour and a half at a time.Instead of spending the entire review complaining about these headphones, I will offer a solution. For the EXACT SAME PRICE, you can buy the entry level *real* Sennheiser's, the 
  
HD449







  
  
     (or whatever is in it's place by the time you read this comment). With the HD449's you get an overall clearer and more detailed sound and are more comfortable to wear. Personally, my next headphone will be an

My ears aren't big top to bottom but they stick out far from my head which has limited my brands to Sennheiser and Bose only so far. These have strategically placed drivers that don't make contact with my ears at all, which even Sennheiser falls short of.Now the bad stuff:There's no passive mode for noise cancellation. It's either ""aware"" where it pipes through sound picked up by the mic or ""quiet"" which is your (admittedly very good) active noise cancellation. Having no passive means that if you're performing any tasks that produce sharp noises like snapping twigs, chopping wood, even cooking with a loud pop coming from the pan, the microphone won't be able to keep up and you'll get an extremely uncomfortable pressure and additional, millisecond delayed pop or snap coming from the headphones themselves.If you're driving on a loud road(and I assume flying as well) the noise cancellation will need to ramp up to compensate and while better than many other brands, the pressure on your ears can become intense and uncomfortable.If you're lying on your side, head on pillow and you put a little too much weight on the headphones, the drivers (and hence the fancy destructive interference waves from the active noise cancellation) get just a little too close to function properly and start ringing with a pitch like a smoke alarm. To get the full effect, you really must try it right as you're about to fall asleep, letting your head finally relax from the long day's stress.All of those faults could be fixed with a passive mode that does not at the time of writing this exist.As for the sound:It's fine. The bass is there and totally loud enough but not super punchy or well defined. The mids and highs are likewise fine. No complaints exactly but somehow Bose managed to strip the joy out of a lot of listening experiences. Excellent compromise I guess. And the longer I listen, the less I'm annoyed by what's lacking.

Each one lasts about six months, or probably about 300 hours of play time. The sound quality is fine, but a real audiophile would probably want something more. They're comfy enough to wear while sleeping; I use them primarily to listen to music, audiobooks, or podcasts as I fall asleep. The battery life is pretty good. I only have to charge them every other day or so, though again, I don't use them very heavily. Each previous set I've had has lasted about six months, and then they don't charge, they randomly turn on and off, or they just stop working altogether. At this price, six months of life is acceptable for me. Would it be better if they lasted longer? Of course.

Because the two buds are not paired at the same time, the buds flash independent of one another (not at the same time). I prefer something more subtle and would rather not piss off someone I'm sitting next to when on the plane or train.- Voice over is annoying. On removal of the buds from the charging case, there will be a woman's voice saying that the device has been turned on, right ear connected, left ear connected, etc. Similarly, when turning the devices on/off manually by holding the button on the side, it'll beep and say device on/off. Superunnecessary, things like this should be seamless - just remove it from the case and start the music.- Connection drops out - over the course of about an hour and half walking throughout NYC, the connection dropped off two times. It managed to auto-fix itself without having to do anything, but still a slight annoyance.- No volume control on the buds themselves.- Not too fond of the fit despite trying all bud shapes. You're supposed to turn these at an angle toward the back of the ear but it still didn't feel that secure. It fell out once when walking as I raised my arm and brushed my ear lightly. I can't really compare it to other wireless buds as this was my first pair. The standard corded apple earbuds are still my go to.Good points:- It'll last at least 2 hours per charge as I haven't tested it for longer.- Call quality/mic seem to be okay. I've only tested them with ~a minute long call.",AFNZD42NDBJYZUUKWDKUEVLOKUKA,https://www.amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFNZD42NDBJYZUUKWDKUEVLOKUKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,Verified Purchase,TOZO,"October 23, 2019",United States,[],0.0,,-0.9039334275505759

However, I feel obligated to add to the rave reviews these have received for my own sanity. Simply put, these are AWESOME!I am currently listening to these earbuds and cannot believe I didn't pull the trigger on these bad boys long ago. Up til now I had been using apple earplugs (the kind that come with an ipod/iphone) and didn't know what I was missing until these arrived.A couple notable aspects:1} There are also 3 sizes of rubber covering that you can easily swap out depending on individual preference. They are perfectly constructed to snuggle into your ear and stay put during any physical activity. I found the apple buds to be tough to keep in my ear when trying to go for a run or workout and these do not budge when active.2) The sound quality is superb. I have owned 2 pairs of Studio Beats by Dre and prefer to wear these any day of the week. They sound just as full and smooth and seem to contain noise much better than my Beats.3) They are $74) They are $7MAKE THE SWITCH!

Still, the sound is pretty good, but nowhere near the raves I’ve read. They’re no better than the standard issue Apple ones, and I do think the Apples are a bit better (though much more pricey).

I use them daily for gaming - Discord calls and general streaming purposes. They have lasted much longer than many other pairs I have had and having the duel audio jacks proved very helpful for different situations. I used an inline mic for about 6 months while using these and had some audio issues with the one provided (crackle feedback). I found replacements online that lasted maybe 2 months each and eventually switched over to a sepertate mic setup. I now only use the 1/4 audio cable with no issue what-so-ever with sound. Overall the experience was great for being bought way back in May of 2020. Only gripe now (Jan 2022) is the plastic hinge that offers a rotation for 'DJ mode' has essentially given out and can now spin a free 360. This wouldn't be an issue if the headphones did not rely on this for support on the head but now the right headphone is slightly lifted off the bottom of the ear during use. Other than that the 'leather' ear cushions started to fray about 8-9 months after buying. Still comfortable but definitely not stylish. I recommend these if you are planning on using them for anything from everyday to sparingly as they seem to last in terms of audio quality and cord lifespan (1/4 jack). I will most likely be repurchasing these to just refresh the look and have the original comfortable fit it provided.,AGBF77TTMU5VO7ZZJDJYL5HXNVWQ,https://www.amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGBF77TTMU5VO7ZZJDJYL5HXNVWQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,Verified Purchase,OneOdio,"February 2, 2022",United States,"[""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61KrQx4SRyL._SY88.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61lIWkH+eTL._SY88.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ie3jYcVXL._SY88.jpg""]",2.0,,-0.9014051068912852

So far I am very impressed. For the price of $5 it would be VERY difficult to find another pair of earbuds that sound as good as these. That said, don't expect anything too amazing from them, but don't expect too little either. After listening to a lot of songs, all of which have moderate bass I can tell you that they sound very good. The bass is pretty solid too, unless you want to feel your ears reverberating. You can notice the bass, and feel a tiny bit of reverberation, but not a whole lot. But the bass is noticeable.One very important thing about these headphones is that they are very good at canceling noise. Listening to music at a medium level it was hard for me to hear when someone 5 feet away from me would say something in a normal voice. The only thing even remotely close to a complaint with these earbuds is the quality of the cord. It feels relatively cheep and there's nothing to slide up and down to prevent the earbuds from tangling. That said, it's a very minor complaint, and for $5 earbuds I really don't care very much. I definitely do not regret getting these earbuds and would recommend them for anyone looking for a good pair of earbuds for not much money. That said, if you're someone who wants or expects high quality sound with great bass these probably aren't for you; but for earbuds on a budget they're great!",AGY3JHMTCABFOUTJTCO6QDAU4VYA,https://www.amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGY3JHMTCABFOUTJTCO6QDAU4VYA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,Verified Purchase,Panasonic,"August 19, 2012",United States,[],1.0,,0.8634070374748923

I tried buying a wire cord that attached to my old earbuds, but that was a pain too — the cord would need to be removed to charge the old earbuds or interfere with controls.  Because earbuds never fit into my ear right (I have small ear canal), I was reluctant to get AirPods.  I didn’t want to lose something expensive on walks.Then I see these - already wired together so don’t have to worry about losing one. Charges with wire. And comes with different sized ear pieces, so I could choose the right size for my ear.

Penrose,B00IT0IHOY,10950.0,5012.0,"Incredible sound, long life - Updated December 2015",RDUVXW12NMK8H,"I've had a pair of these beasts for more than two years now and I've never had a better set of 'phones sonically.Like a number of other people, I find the plastic cover of the headband is cracking and shedding pieces to the point now where it looks like I use the headphones to drive nails.Apparently the outer shell just does not flex enough and I do have a somewhat larger than average head.  It's annoying and looks awful but until they actually fall apart I'll keep using them and then will probably buy another set.Sonically, they are simply incredible.  I use a small portable CD player and it drives them just fine, even on battery power.The noise isolation is wonderful, I use these on airplane trips and most of the noise just vanishes, at home, I often don't hear the telephone ringing on the end table next to me and I don't listen to particularly loud music.  I can enjoy quiet music while my wife watches TV 6' away and barely register that it is on.Every time I play a CD for the first time using these 'phones, I am usually astounded, especially if I've heard the music before on lesser systems. It's like hearing it for the first time.  The depth and clarity simply delight me and I am constantly hearing new things or nuances in the music, even on discs I have heard a hundred times before.The bass is full and rich without sounding like you've plugged your speakers directly into a 60hz AC outlet. (Which seems to be a popular thing to do judging from what some people call ""bass"" but which is more like the sound made when a brontosauraus has really bad gas.)  Highs are crisp and clear without sounding tinny or ringing and the soundstage is just right at least for me.I use these primarily for classical, jazz and new age/ambient with occasional excursions into classic rock and they just simply work.  I can't comment on how they sound with ""rap"" or similar noise as I only use these to listen to real music, not someone screaming vulgar words while thumping on a bass drum, but I digress.If you want quality sound with great isolation, buy these, just don't wear them while bicycling or driving, OK?  You won't hear the semi-truck coming through your windshield.;)Update:  In late 2007 I bought another pair of these.  I think they may have solved the cracking headband issue.  I use them almost daily often for two or three hours at a time and the new set does not seem to be showing any signs of the older pair's issues.  Sound quality is still the best I've heard, especially for the money.  They are heavy and a bit hot and the cups could be a bit deeper...they press on my ears a bit after long wear but I've yet to find anything else I like as much.Update to the update:  July 2009.  Still use them heavily almost every day.  Headband is fine, no noticeable wear, cracking or other issues.  I think Sennheiser listened to people.Buy these 'phones!  I've used them now with almost every decent portable music player around, my PC and my stereo.  They just sound good and they keep sounding good.Update cubed - Late May 2011  Still using the same 'phones.  No cracking of headband, no loss of quality.  Only noticeable degradation is that the ear cushions have gotten a bit squishy.  I think they are user replaceable.  I wear these things a good ten hours a week.  I really cannot say enough good things about this product.  There are still companies that know how to make a quality product and offer it at a fair price.Update the 4th - Late in 2012, the ear cushions pretty much gave up the ghost and these things became very uncomfortable to wear.I was going to pitch them and get something newer when I ran a cross a ""how to"" video from Sennheiser on how to replace the ear cushions.  Turns out to be reasonably easy...watch the video a couple of times as the tech kind of gets his hands in the way in a critical shot or two.  You don't need any tools, just some patience and a willingness to stretch the cushions farther than you think they will stretch.So, I located a (non-Amazom, they didn't have them) source, ordered a set of cushions and once I got them installed (maybe ten minutes work and some cursing as this kind of manual dexterity has never been my long suit), I now have a practically new set of phones that just keep on working.  The headband cushion could use replacing but it's not critical so I am not going to bother.  Cost of the ear cushions was in the mid $20 range, so if they last as long as the original set (and they feel of similar quality, I should be updating this in another four or five years.  :0Update the Fifth - End of December. 2015  Replacement ear pads have held up nicely.  All aspects of the headphone are fine except the strain relief connection where the cord joins the plug has frayed away and it only hangs on by the actual wiring and I expect that to go sooner rather than later and it is NOT user replaceable.That will end my long and lovely relationship with these 'phones.I find I rarely use them now as I obtained a gorgeous pair of Phillips Fidelio headphones earlier in 2015 and they just keep growing on me for any use that does not require the solid sound isolation these provide.But I have gotten more than my money's worth out of the Sennheisers.

And when I'm listening to people talking or singing, they sound like they're singing or talking through a can.  Nothing sounds right, and I've run through everything from Adagio for Strings to Comfortably Numb.I'm not kidding:  You can get better sound from a ten dollar pair of headphones, so please don't buy them.  I'm stuck with these till I get something better, which shouldn't be difficult.  The packaging included a card from the manufacturer requesting a review, and I think people tried to be kind and post something nice, and that's why these headphones are so highly rated.  I'm not an expert on headphones, but I know what sounds bad.  Please just don't, because the sound quality is so poor, I feel like I'm going crazy listening to them.They look nice, but are not comfortable, either.
